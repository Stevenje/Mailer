Hi #{profile.name.split(" ")[0]},<br><br>

I hope this message finds you well, I came across your GitHub Profile (#{profile.html_url}) with great interest as I noticed you had made several significant Python focused open-source contributions.<br><br>

I was just looking to touch base with you regarding an Award Winning Financial UK Tech Startup called Funding Options. They are revolutionising the online Financial market with their unique and innovative ideas on financial risk and stock management.<br><br>

Their dev teams are usually split up into smaller teams (4 or 5 devs), working in a very lean Agile way practising Scrum & TDD. They use Python and Pyramid extensively, however they are keen on attracting the best Python developers in the market who have experience with frameworks such as Django, Flask or Pyramid.<br><br>

They are VC backed by several very renowned figures when it comes to successful entrepreneurs, including board members of one of Europe’s Top 10 Startups, Funding Circle and two of Bank Of America most successful VP’s of engineering. They are looking to rapidly expand their development team with now multiple strong back end python developers. They are considering Mid-Level, Senior and Lead Developers and are paying very attractive salaries, with potential stock options. They have recently secured stunning offices in the Centre of London overlooking the Thames, near tower bridge.<br><br>

Please let me know if you would be interested in finding out more regarding this excellent opportunity to work for one of the most talked about Startups in London, or if you know anyone else who may be interested, we offer a generous referral fee.<br><br>

If you aren't interested #{profile.name.split(" ")[0]} for whatever reason, it’s still worth getting back to me as I have a number of other exciting Python Development positions that may catch your eye.<br><br>

I look forward to your response,<br><br>
Best regards,<br>
